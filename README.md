# pathfinding-project

## Overview

This project implements and visualizes the A* (A-star) pathfinding algorithm, which is widely used in various applications requiring efficient pathfinding. The A* algorithm combines aspects of Dijkstra's algorithm and Greedy Best-First Search to find the shortest path from a start node to a goal node in a grid-based environment

## Features

- **A {*} Algorithm**: Visualizes the pathfinding process using the A* algorithm.
- **Interactive Pygame Visualization**: Utilizes Pygame to render a dynamic grid-based environment, including obstacles, start, and goal positions. Provides real-time visualization of the pathfinding process and the resulting path.
- **Detailed Performance Metrics**: Displays key performance metrics including the total number of nodes processed and the final path length. This information is presented below the visualization, offering insights into the algorithmâ€™s      efficiency and performance.

## Installation
```
1. Clone the Repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Rohnnam/pathfinding-project.git
   cd pathfinding-project

2. Set Up the Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):

  python3 -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install Dependencies:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```


**Working**
```
Grid Initialization:
 A grid is initialized with random obstacles and a fixed start point at the center of the grid. The goal point is set by user interaction.

Algorithm Execution:
Upon setting the goal point, the A* algorithm is executed. The algorithm explores nodes using a priority queue, considering both the cost to reach a node and an estimate of the cost to reach the goal.

Visualization and Animation:
The pathfinding process is visualized in real-time. The grid updates to show the exploration of nodes and the final path, with an incremental animation to depict the algorithm's progress.

Metrics Display:
After the pathfinding completes, performance metrics are updated and displayed, showing the efficiency of the algorithm in terms of nodes processed and path length.
