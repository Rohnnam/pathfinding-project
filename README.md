# pathfinding-project

## Overview

This project demonstrates pathfinding visualization using the A* algorithm with Pygame. It visualizes the process of finding the shortest path between a start and goal point on a grid, with obstacles that block movement. The visualization includes performance metrics such as the number of nodes processed and the length of the path.

## Features

- **A {*} Algorithm**: Visualizes the pathfinding process using the A* algorithm.
- **Pygame Visualization**: Displays the grid, obstacles, start and goal points, and the path.
- **Incremental Path Drawing**: Animates the pathfinding process by coloring each cell along the path incrementally.
- **Performance Metrics**: Shows the number of nodes processed and the length of the path.
